<h1>Fishing Buddy - Front</h1>
<p>Follow this link to use the complete app: <a href="">Fishing Buddy</a></p>

<p>This application was designed with fly-fishermen (and woman) in mind!</p>
<h4>Features:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Authentication: Users are able to create an account with a secure login. They can edit their account and add a custom picuture. Their account is tied to a Fishing Log. Users are able to delete their account.</li>
<li>Users are able to view fly-patterns, add a new pattern, and add a new color for a specific pattern without an account.</li>
<li>Users are able to view fly-patterns by the insect family they mimic.</li>
<li>Users are able to click on different color pictures to view a large picture of the pattern with that color.</li>
<li>Users with an account can add to their fishing log to keep track of:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The date they went fishing.</li>
    <li>What River they went fishing on.</li>
    <li>Notes on River access (to remember from last time).</li>
    <li>Pattern color that worked the best (using patterns and colors available)</li>
    <li>A picture from the day</li>
    <li>Comments on the day. (To jog their memory for next time.)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>As a fly-fisher woman, I wanted to design a site where I could record my fly fishing experiences - making it easy to recall where and when I was fishing and with what pattern.</p>

<br>
<br>

<h5>Future features I want to be able to implement</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Edit each fishing log entry</li>
  <li>Create a new feature - A Shopping list</li>
   <p>This would enable the user to add specific colored-patterns into a shopping list with the intention of having this list texted to them so that they can go to a fly shop on the way to the river</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Each pattern color would have a button to add to a user's shopping list and an indication if it is already in the User's list</li>
  <li>Each list item would have a delete button</li>
  <li>There would be a clear list button</li>
  <li>AND a button to text the list to the user's phone</li>
</ul>
</ul>
